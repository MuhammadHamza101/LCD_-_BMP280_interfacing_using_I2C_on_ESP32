DIY Mini Weather Station with ESP32 and I2C: Pocket-Sized Weather Forecasting!
Build your own mini weather station with this project! This DIY setup utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller and I2C communication to fetch real-time temperature, pressure, and altitude data from a BMP280 sensor and display it on an LCD screen.

Features:

I2C communication: Efficient data transfer between ESP32, BMP280, and LCD.
Real-time weather data: Display temperature, pressure, and altitude on the LCD.
Single Master, multiple Slaves: ESP32 acts as the master, controlling both BMP280 and LCD.
Compact and portable: Fits in your pocket for personal weather forecasting on the go!
This project is perfect for:

Beginners exploring embedded systems and I2C communication.
Hobbyists interested in building their own weather station.
Makers looking for a fun and practical project.
